# Learn HTML with Scrimba

Welcome to my journey of mastering HTML through Scrimba! This repository documents my progress, notes, and projects as I learn the fundamentals of web development.

## About This Project

This project is a collection of exercises, code snippets, and resources from my experience with the Scrimba HTML course. It serves as both a personal reference and a showcase of my growth as a web developer.

## My Learning Journey

I started learning HTML to build a strong foundation in web development. Scrimba's interactive tutorials have helped me understand key concepts such as:

- Structuring web pages with semantic HTML
- Using headings, paragraphs, lists, and links
- Incorporating images and multimedia
- Creating forms and tables
- Best practices for accessibility and clean code

Throughout this journey, I've built several mini-projects and documented my learnings in this repository. Each commit reflects a new concept or milestone achieved.

## How to Use This Repo

Feel free to explore the code, follow along with the exercises, or use the resources to kickstart your own HTML learning adventure.
